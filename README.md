# bike-sharing_systems

We perform an analysis in bike-sharing systems. More specifically, we worked with stochastic models and the database of Velib' (large-scale public bicycle sharing system in Paris, France).

*Insights*

After comparing policies in the Velib' system, with a well defined metric related to customer dissatisfaction (proportion of full and empty stations), we found that incentivazing the bike returns in the station with the greatest number of available slots is not the best strategy, since stations with small capacities may be neglected in the process. By the other hand, when choosing the stations with the greatest number of available slots with respect to its total capacity, then, we have an improvement in the system. More specifically, a mean improvement of 16% (in respect to the defined metric) and the studied scenarios.
